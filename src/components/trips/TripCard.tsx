// This component's logic has been integrated into src/app/page.tsx (MyTripsPage)
// for simplicity in this refactoring step. If TripCard becomes more complex
// or is reused elsewhere, it can be extracted back into this file.

// Keeping the file to avoid breaking imports if any other part of the thought process assumed its existence.
// For now, it's effectively unused as MyTripsPage defines its own TripCard inline.
