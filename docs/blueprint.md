## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to evoke a sense of calmness and reliability, suitable for planning.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), provides a clean, uncluttered backdrop to keep focus on the travel plans.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#FFB74D), adds a touch of excitement, and contrasts with the primary blue to draw attention to important elements or actions.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) provides a modern and geometric look.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to maintain readability and clarity for longer descriptions or notes. Pairing Poppins with PT Sans ensures both modernity and ease of reading.
- Lucide React icons offer simple, modern, and consistent visual cues.
- Spacious design with '2xl rounded' elements, soft shadows, and generous spacing; follow a clear and accessible layout using Tailwind CSS.
- Subtle micro-animations using Framer Motion for smooth transitions (animation duration < 90ms), drag-and-drop feedback, and general user interface enhancements.
